## Terms

### Programming System
In contrast to the term _programming language_ that emphasises the language as
the essential aspect of programming the (almost antique) point of view of a 
_programming system_ emphasises an integrated understanding of the overall 
process of making software that depends on and is influence by many aspects 
one of which is the language. 

In a programming system other aspects of the overall programming activity 
influence the design of the language in such a way that it supports these 
aspects well. The language is designed with a system in mind and the system
vice versa to fit the language.

In the bruno programming system the [formalism](#formalism) has been designed
so that its properties allow to develop software in a particular way. This 
applies from program design up to deployment, maintenance, testing. The
concerns span...

### Local Reasoning
_Local reasoning_ should be understood as a form of 
[formal](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Effective_Reasoning/Informal_and_Formal_Reasoning) 
or [deductive reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) 
that is possible to do in a narrow local context. 
This implies that everything that has to be considered is directly (locally) 
present/affected. It means all consequences (effects) are direct as well.
Thereby correct and complete reasoning becomes possible without taking the
_outside world_ into account. 
The process of reasoning is simplified by reducing the number of significant 
aspects and the impossibility of _external_ aspects, that are not represented 
in the local context.
