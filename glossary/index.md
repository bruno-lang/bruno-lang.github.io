### Programming System
In contrast to the term _programming language_ that emphasises the language as
the essential aspect of programming the (almost antique) point of view of a 
_programming system_ emphasises an integrated understanding of the overall 
process of making software that depends on and is influence by many aspects 
one of which is the language. 

In a programming system other aspects of the overall programming activity 
influence the design of the language in such a way that it supports these 
aspects well. The language is designed with a system in mind and the system
vice versa to fit the language.

In the bruno programming system the [formalism](#formalism) has been designed
so that its properties allow to develop software in a particular way. This 
applies from program design up to deployment, mainteinance, testing. The
concerns span...

### Local Reasoning
_Local reasoning_ should be understood as a form of

or [deductive reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) 
that can be applied in a local context. Everything that has to be reasoned 
about is direcly present. All consequences of any deduction will directly 
only affect the local context itself.
