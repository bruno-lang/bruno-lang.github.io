### Programming System
In contrast to the term _programming language_ that emphasises the language as
the essential aspect the (almost antique) point of view of a _programming system_ 
emphasises the idea that the programming experience does not just depend upon
and is influence by the language but by the whole system in which a language 
is used beside the other tools to make software and the process and values that 
go hand and hand with these.

In a programming system other aspects of the overall programming activity 
influence the design of the language in such a way that it supports these 
aspects well. The language is designed with a system in mind in which it is used.
